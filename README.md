## lamp.py
This is a python 3 script which installs lamp stack on Ubuntu 18.04. While I made it only for learning purposes it is fully functional and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
It is heavily based on this tutorial https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/lamp/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-18-04/ including all necessary changes in configuration files.
